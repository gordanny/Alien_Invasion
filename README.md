# Alien Invasion

Alien Invasion is a Space Invadersâ€“style shooting game, written on Python 3 with [PyGame library](https://www.pygame.org/).
This is the first of three projects by [Eric Matthes's](https://ehmatthes.github.io/) book [Python Crash Course](https://www.amazon.com/Eric-Matthes/e/B01DPU378I%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share).
I made small changes to the initial project, such as:
- replacing ship images
- background image instead of fill
- a change in the record occurs after the end of the game, not during it
